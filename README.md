# docker/docker-install
Home of the script that lives at `get.docker.com` and `test.docker.com`!

The purpose of the install script is for a convenience for quickly
installing the latest Docker-CE releases on the supported linux
distros. It is not recommended to depend on this script for deployment
to production systems. For more thorough instructions for installing
on the supported distros, see the [install
instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

This repository is solely maintained by Docker, Inc.

## Usage:

Install Docker from the source repo (This will install latest from the `stable` channel):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/QubitPi/docker-install.git
cd docker-install
sh install.sh
```

### Executing the Docker Command Without Sudo

By default, the docker command can only be run by the root user or by a user in the docker group, which is automatically
created during Docker's installation process. We cannot run the docker command without prefixing it with "sudo" or 
without being in the docker group. If we want to avoid typing "sudo" whenever we run the docker command, add our 
username to the docker group:

```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

To apply the new group membership, log out of the server and back in

## Testing:

To verify that the install script works amongst the supported operating systems run:

```shell
make shellcheck
```
